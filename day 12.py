#finger exercise. write a program that examines three  variables, x , y z and prints the larges odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.


x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
if x%2 = 0 and x > y and y > z:
      print 'x is the largest odd among x, y, and z'
  elif y%2 !== 0 and y > z and z > x:
     print 'y is the largest odd among x, y, and z'
  elif z%2 !== 0 and z > y and y > x:
     print 'z is the largest odd among x, y, and z'
  elif x%2 == 0 or y % 2 == 0 or z%2 == 0:
     print 'even'
